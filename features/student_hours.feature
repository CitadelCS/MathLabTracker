Feature: Student can view their hours on the MathLabTracker
  
As a student at The Citadel
So I can get credit for being at the Math Lab
I want to view my hours on MathLabTracker
  
Scenario: A student logs into MathLabTracker
  
    Given the following students exist:
  | CWID     | first_name  | last_name | teacher    | count |
  | 10519447 | George      | Olivetti  | Moore      | 1     |
